# Coverage

Coverage is the number of aligned sequence reads overlapping a particular reference position in the genome. The gnomAD coverage track displays the average coverage across 10% of the samples, computed for exomes and genomes separately. Note that because gnomAD encompasses a lot of different projects that used different exome capture kits / sequencing technologies, the coverage displayed in the track might not be representative of all individuals at that position.
