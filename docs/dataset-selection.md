# Selecting datasets

The data selection drop-down specifies which dataset is displayed on the page. Currently these are:

+ gnomAD v2.0.2 (exomes + genomes combined)
+ ExAC v1.0 (same data from [exac.broadinstitute.org](exac.broadinstitute.org))

In the future, we plan for this drop-down to include non-psych, non-TCGA, and non-Bravo gnomAD subsets.

The dataset selection drop-down updates data such as the coverage plot, constraint statistics, regional constraint, and variant positional distribution plot.
